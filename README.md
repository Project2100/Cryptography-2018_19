## Requirements

Package 'nonotation': [GitHub](https://github.com/Project2100/math-nonotation.git)

### Document structure

Currently, the document is split as the crypto lessons themselves, to preserve the original course timeline; most lesson files do keep a comment with the date.

## Contributing

Lessons are over, thus the only work to do here is of a reviewing nature. If you ever feel the need, you can contact me at my e-mail address.
